% ================ IMAGE FOLDER(S) =======================
%% there are two options for pointing the program to the folder(s) on your computer which contains the images to be processed
%% option 1 is to hard-wire the full path to the folder. For just 1 directory, create a string e.g.:
%folder = 'C:\Documents and Settings\dbuscombe\Desktop\example_images';


%% if more than 1 folder, create a cellular array with folders, e.g.:
%folder{1} = 'C:\Documents and Settings\dbuscombe\Desktop\example_images2';
%folder{2} = 'C:\Documents and Settings\dbuscombe\Desktop\example_images3';

%% option 3 is to leave the folder option out, or empty, or set to zero, e.g.
folder = 0;

% ================ IMAGE RESOLUTION =======================
% res is the image resolution (mm/pixel)
res = 0.04;

% ================ PROCESSING DENSITY =======================
% density at which the image is sampled. If N=density, the program will 
% analyse every Nth row of the image, so the larger the density, 
%the quicker the processing time but the less accurate the result
density=50;

% ================ SMALLEST GRAIN SCALE =======================
% the smallest grain scale to consider. This is a value in pixels
start_size=1;

% ================ IMAGE FILTERING =======================
filter = 0; % 1 = yes, 0 = no

%% if filter=1, then you need to specify options
%filtoptions.boost = 3; 
%filtoptions.CutOff = .2; 
%filtoptions.order = 2;

% ================ IMAGE FLATTENING =======================
flatten = 1; % 1 = yes, 0 = no

% ================ REQUESTED OUTPUTS =======================
return_used_image = 1; % 1 = yes, 0 = no

% if verbose =1, more commentary printed to screen
verbose = 0;
